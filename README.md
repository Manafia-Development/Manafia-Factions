## 🎮 What is Manafia factions

We've optimized nearly every single class with performance in mind. We have fully stress-tested the entire plugin. In
some cases, this plugin saves 1.8MB of RAM per player, starts up 200% faster and with the proper configuration, it can
claim 1 million chunks in just 20 seconds! These results will vary depending on hardware.

## ⚡️ Features

- Raids
- Lunar Client Integration
- Boosters
- Shields
- Cloaked Chunks
- Configure CPU cores for claiming
- Condensed YML files
- Re-polished entire plugin
- More configuration
- Choose how many CPU cores are used during claiming!
- Alts
- TNT

## 🚀 Installation

Install Vault, EssentialsX and Lunar-API if you wish to enable Lunar integration.

After the plugin is compiled, the final jar will be located in the ``/target`` directory. Take the *non-shaded* jar and
upload that into your servers ``/plugins`` folder.

## For the future

In future releases, we hope to add KOTH, duels, conquest and more. This would require a lot of time and effort, so any
help is appreciated especially considering this would all be free and open-source.
